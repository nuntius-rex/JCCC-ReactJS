# JCCC-ReactJS
This is code from my ReactJS class. Many of the examples here are based on the book we use called Learning React, by Kirup Chinnathambi (https://www.kirupa.com/react/). 
It is a pretty good learning start. However, in some case I have fixed, expanded or added my own additional content due to working with and explaining features to students. I hope you find it helpful!
